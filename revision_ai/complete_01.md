## **Scenario 1: Setting up a new Ubuntu 20.04 development server**

Youâ€™ve just provisioned a new Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You need to:

1. Update package lists and upgrade the system.
2. Install `nginx`, `git`, and `curl`.
3. Verify details about the `nginx` package (dependencies, description, and config files).
4. You realize you installed the wrong package version, so you reinstall it.
5. Later, you decide to completely remove `nginx` including config files.
6. Clean up unused dependencies.
7. Check for broken packages and verify dependencies.

## **Scenario 2: Debugging a `.deb` package issue**

Your teammate gave you a custom `.deb` package named `myapp_1.0.deb`. You need to:

1. Inspect the `.deb` file to see package info before installing.
2. Install it manually.
3. Verify if the package is installed and check its status.
4. List which files the package installed.
5. Later, you discover conflicts, so you purge it completely.
6. Finally, check if any broken packages remain.

## **Scenario 3: Fedora 34 workstation upgrade**

On a Fedora 34 desktop:

1. Update repositories and upgrade all packages.
2. Search for `htop` and check detailed info before installing it.

4. Use `rpm` to verify which files were installed by `htop`.
5. Later, upgrade an `.rpm` package (`customapp.rpm`) provided by your vendor.
6. You mistakenly installed the wrong package, so you erase it.
7. List all currently installed packages with `rpm`.

3. List all running containers.
4. Exec into the container to check `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`.
