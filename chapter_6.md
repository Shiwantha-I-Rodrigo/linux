## systemd

> A **unit** in systemd defines a service, group of services or an action.

priority order when two unit files have same name,

1. /etc/systemd/system (Highest) (**update proof**)
2. /run/systemd/system
3. /usr/lib/systemd/system (Lowest)

**Unit Files**

| Extension         | Purpose|
|-                  |-|
| **.service**      | Define how a daemon or a background process should be managed|
|                   | What executable to Start, stop, reload, enable, disable (with what arguments)|
|                   | When (on boot)(other service start)(etc.)|
|                   | How to manage (restart on failure)(check dependencies)(limit restarts)(etc.)|
|                   | Under what conditions (networking is up)(etc.)|
| **.socket**       | Define socket-based activation for services, saves resources|
|                   | Systemd listens on a socket and start the relevent service when a connection is made|
|                   | **Activtes service of the same name, unless *Service=* option is set**|
| **.target**       | Group and coordinate other unit files to achieve a common goal|
|                   | Boot into a specific system mode by killing / starting units as defined|
|                   | **graphical.target** - multiuser + GUI|
|                   | **multi-user.target** - multiuser|
|                   | **rescue.target** - singleuser(root) + all local filesystems + no networking|
|                   | **emergency.target** - singleuser(root) + root filesystem + no networking|
|                   | **reboot.target** - reboot system|
|                   | **poweroff.target** - shutdown system|
|                   | **halt.target** - halt system immediately|
|                   | Kill / start multiple services together by making a custom target (gaming.target)|
| **.timer**        | Schedule tasks based on events or date-time similar to cron|
|                   | **Activtes service of the same name, unless *Unit=* option is set**|
| **.mount**        | Define the mounting options of each file system|
|                   | Systemd-native replacement for traditional entries in /etc/fstab|
|                   | Systemd auto-generate .mount files for fstab entries|
|                   | Enable easy control of filesystems (`$ systemctl start my-mount.mount`)|
|                   | Dependency handling (after=network.target for NFS)|
|                   | **Naming rule : */home/user/share/ --> home-user-share.mount***|
| **.automount**    | Automatically mount / unmount a filesystem on-demand|
|                   | Systemd triggers `home-user-share.mount` if user accessed `/home/user/share/`|
|                   | Automatically unmount after a specific idle seconds|
|                   | Improves boot speed and saves resources|
|                   | .automount must have a .mount file of the same name|
|                   | **Naming rule : */home/user/share/ --> home-user-share.automount***|
| **.path**         | Define event-based(file system) activation for services|
|                   | Monitor a file / directory and trigger a service when a change occurs|
|                   | **Activtes service of the same name, unless *Unit=* option is set**|
| **.device**       | Auto-generated by systemd when the device becomes availabe|
|                   | The unit file itself does not trigger any unit by becoming availabe|
|                   | But the device file can referenced on another unit to trigger itself|
|                   | Ie. auto-mount when the device become availabe|
|                   | **Naming rule : */dev/sda1 --> dev-sda1.device***|
| **.swap**         | Define the mounting options of swap file systems, similar to **.mount** unit files|
|                   | see **.mount** unit file|
| **.slice**        | Define resource management for groups of processes using Linux control groups (cgroups)|
|                   | **system.slice** - system services|
|                   | **user.slice** - user sessions|
|                   | **init.slice** - PID 1 and early boot processes|
|                   | Limit resources for certain processes|
| **.scope**        | Define management of externally started processes (not launched by systemd)|
|                   | Place external processes into control groups (cgroups)|
|                   | Auto-generated by tools such as|
|                   | **loginctl** - user sessions|
|                   | **systemd-run** - manual processes|
|                   | **machinectl** - virtual machines or containers|
|                   | **desktop-environments**|
| **.snapshot**     | Capture the current state of the system’s active units |
|                   | Restore the system to a previous state without rebooting or manually restarting services|

| **indirect**                          | The unit is not enabled directly by the user|
|                                       | but is enabled as a dependency of another unit|
| **masked**                            | The unit is completely blocked|

## SysV

instead of targets, sysV uses run levels,

|REDHAT ||
|-      |-|
|0      | shutdown|
|1,s,S  | single user mode (system maintenance)|
|2      | multiuser without networking|
|3      | multiuser|
|4      | custom|
|5      | multiuser with GUI|
|6      | reboot|

|DEBIAN ||
|-      |-|
|0      | shutdown|
|1      | single user mode|
|2      | multiuser with GUI|
|6      | reboot|

    $ runlevel
    N   2

    # runlevel shows ( previous ) and ( current ) runlevels.
    # N for newly booted.

In sysV `/etc/inittab` file was **used** to start services\
But later it has been used to set system run level and start terminal services.

    $ grep :initdefault: /etc/inittab
    id:5:initdefault:

| Feature               | Debian            | Red Hat|
|-                      |-                  |-|
| **Init scripts**      | `/etc/init.d/`    | `/etc/rc.d/init.d/`|
| **rc script**         | `/etc/init.d/rc`  | `/etc/rc.d/rc`|
| **rc directories**    | `/etc/rcX.d/`     | `/etc/rc.d/rcX.d/`|
| **rc.local**          | `/etc/rc.local`   | `/etc/rc.d/rc.local`|

Each service must have a initialization script loaded in **Init scripts** directory.( **\*** ) indicates that they are executable bash scripts.

the program that calls these scripts is the **rc script**.

each run level has its own directory (**rc directories**). each runlevel directory has symbolic links of service initialization scripts.

**rc.local** script allows adding additional scripts to be run after system initialization.

**rc directories** directory example,

    $ ls /etc/rc.d/rc3.d

    K01smolt@
    K02avahi-dnsconfd@
    ...
    K99readahead_later@
    S00microde_ctl@
    S04readahead_early@
    ...
    S55cups@

> **K** = KILL\
> **S** = START\
> **00-99** = the number indicate the order to kill or start service\
> **@** = symbolic link

    $ readlink -f /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S55cups
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/cups

> **rc** script run through all the kill scripts first then start scripts, allowing switching between run levels on the fly.

***Change run level : `$ init 3` / `$ telinit 3`***

***Manage services : `$ service [service] [option]`***

| Option    | Description |
|-          |-|
|restart    |restart the service
|           |if not running already, display **failed** but start the service.
|start      |start the service
|status     |show status
|stop       |stop service
|reload     |load config file of running service, fails if service is not running.

***Manage which services start with each run level (REDHAT): `$chkconfig`***

|Command                        | Description |
