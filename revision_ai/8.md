# ðŸ”¹ Scenarios 1

## **Scenario 1 â€“ University Research Backup**

Dr. Kim is working on multiple research projects stored in folders:

* `climate_data/` (CSV files)
* `student_reports/` (text reports)
* `simulations/` (binary output files)

She needs to:

1. Archive all three folders into one file.
2. Ensure the archive is compressed using **different algorithms** for testing efficiency (gzip, bzip2, xz).
3. Verify the contents after creating the archives.
4. Later, extract the bzip2-compressed archive to restore files for a PhD student.
5. Finally, add new reports from `student_reports/new/` into the original tar archive without recreating it.

---

## **Scenario 2 â€“ Startup Dev Team Deployment**

A startup team is preparing application deployment:

* They have config files: `app.conf`, `db.conf`, `cache.conf`.
* The team lead wants all configs packaged neatly.
* The package should also have a **list of contents** stored separately for review.
* Before release, they want to compare the archive contents with the filesystem to ensure no files were missed.
* During an urgent bug fix, the `cache.conf` was updated and needs to be added to the archive incrementally.

---

## **Scenario 3 â€“ Digital Library Migration**

A university library is migrating old text-based catalogs:

* Files: `catalog1.txt`, `catalog2.txt`, `catalog3.txt`.
* They decide to compress the files individually using **gzip**, **bzip2**, and **xz** to see which gives the best ratio.
* Some librarians accidentally compressed the same file twice, so IT needs to decompress them correctly.
* For exchange with another branch, they need to create a **ZIP archive** of all the catalog files.
* Later, they need to **extract the ZIP archive** at the branch library system.

---

## **Scenario 4 â€“ Government Department Data Exchange**

A department is preparing daily logs to send securely to another branch:

* Logs: `day1.log`, `day2.log`, `day3.log`.
* Instead of `tar`, they use `cpio`.
* They want to:

  1. Generate an archive with all logs.
  2. Save it into a file for transfer.
  3. On the receiving side, list the contents before extraction.
  4. Finally, extract the files from the archive into the working directory.

---

## **Scenario 5 â€“ Disaster Recovery Simulation**

An enterprise IT team is simulating a server crash recovery:

* They keep weekly archives of `/etc`, `/var/log`, and `/home/projects`.
* They create **incremental backups** using snapshots.
* After a simulated crash, they restore the files by extracting.
* The compliance officer requests verification of the restored archive.

# ðŸ”¹ Scenarios 2

## **Scenario 1: The Researcherâ€™s Backup**

Dr. Meera is working on a project about climate change. She has three data files:

* `temperature.txt`
* `rainfall.txt`
* `humidity.txt`

She wants to:

1. Bundle them together for archiving.
2. Check the archiveâ€™s contents before sending to her colleague.
3. Later, she realizes she has an updated `humidity.txt` and needs to add it without recreating the whole archive.
4. Before sending, she verifies the archive against the filesystem to ensure everything matches.
5. Finally, she extracts the files on her colleagueâ€™s computer.

---

## **Scenario 2: The System Administratorâ€™s Incremental Backup**

On a Fedora 34 server, Alex maintains log files stored in `/var/logs/app/`.

He needs to:

1. Take a **full backup** of the logs on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, take an **incremental backup** (only changes since Monday).
3. Confirm what files are inside the backup archive.
4. Later, restore the files in case the system crashes.

---

## **Scenario 3: The Studentâ€™s Storage Problem**

Ravi has a collection of notes (`math.txt`, `physics.txt`, `chemistry.txt`).

He wants to:

1. Compress `math.txt` using gzip, `physics.txt` using bzip2, and `chemistry.txt` using xz to compare file sizes.
2. Later, he decompresses each of them to get back the original files.

---

## **Scenario 4: The Designerâ€™s Project Delivery**

A graphic designer needs to deliver project files (`logo.png`, `banner.png`, `flyer.png`) to a client.

She wants to:

1. Create a ZIP archive of all three files.
2. Email it to the client.
3. The client extracts the ZIP on Ubuntu 20.04.

---

## **Scenario 5: The Legacy Engineer**

In an old RockyOS 8.5 environment, a legacy script generates a file list of configuration files:

```
/etc/hosts
/etc/fstab
/etc/passwd
```

The engineer needs to:

1. Archive these files using `cpio`.
2. List the contents of the archive.
3. Later, extract them back from the archive.

---

## **Scenario 6: The Photographerâ€™s Cross-Platform Delivery**

A wildlife photographer has three high-res images (`tiger.jpg`, `lion.jpg`, `elephant.jpg`).

1. She wants to create a compressed archive using gzip directly via tar for quick transfer.
2. Then another archive using bzip2 for long-term storage.
3. Finally, one more using xz for maximum compression.
4. After creating the archives, she verifies that the gzip archive was written correctly.
5. Later, she extracts each compressed archive to confirm the files are intact.

---

## **Scenario 7: The Historianâ€™s Old Archive Conversion**

A historian on RockyOS 8.5 finds an old text list of manuscripts (`manuscripts.txt`):

```
scroll1.txt
scroll2.txt
scroll3.txt
```

1. He creates a cpio archive and writes it explicitly using `-O`.
2. Later, he receives the same archive from another researcher and extracts it using `-I`.
3. Before extraction, he lists its contents.
