## 🔧 1. **Scenario: Backing up and restoring application logs with `tar`**

**Context:** You’re running a production web application on RHEL 8.5. Logs are filling up `/var/log/app/`, and before you rotate them, you want to archive them in case management needs them later.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Create a compressed archive of logs**

   ```bash
   tar -czvf app_logs_2025-08-31.tar.gz /var/log/app/
   ```

   * `-c` → Create archive
   * `-z` → Compress with gzip (fast + common)
   * `-v` → Verbose, so you can see progress
   * `-f` → Output to file

   ✅ You now have a single `.tar.gz` with all logs.

2. **Verify archive contents before moving to backup server**

   ```bash
   tar -tvf app_logs_2025-08-31.tar.gz
   ```

   * `-t` → List archive contents
   * `-v` → Verbose output

3. **Extract when troubleshooting an issue**

   ```bash
   tar -xzvf app_logs_2025-08-31.tar.gz -C /tmp/log_extract/
   ```

   * `-x` → Extract files
   * `-z` → Gzip
   * `-C` → Target directory

➡️ **Real-world troubleshooting story:**
A customer reports a crash last week. You pull the archived logs, extract them, and analyze `/tmp/log_extract/app/error.log` for error timestamps.

## 📦 2. **Scenario: Sharing configs with a teammate using `zip`**

**Context:** Your teammate (on Windows) needs `/etc/nginx` config files for comparison.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Create a zip archive of configs**

   ```bash
   zip -r nginx_configs.zip /etc/nginx/
   ```

   * `-r` → Recursive, include subdirectories

2. **Send to teammate**

   * Since `.zip` is universally supported, Windows users can unpack without extra tools.

➡️ **Real-world troubleshooting story:**
Your teammate finds a misconfiguration in their local nginx.conf compared to your archive. You both fix it and prevent downtime.

## 📂 3. **Scenario: Migrating user home directories with `cpio`**

**Context:** You need to migrate `/home/project/` directory contents from Ubuntu 20.04 to a new system.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Create an archive with `cpio`**

   ```bash
   find /home/project/ | cpio -ov > project_backup.cpio
   ```

   * `find` → Generates file list
   * `-o` → Create archive from input
   * `-v` → Show files as they’re archived

2. **Transfer `project_backup.cpio` to new server**

3. **Extract files on target system**

   ```bash
   cpio -iv < project_backup.cpio
   ```

   * `-i` → Extract
   * `-v` → Verbose

➡️ **Real-world troubleshooting story:**
A developer complains that their scripts are missing after migration. You list archive contents with:

```bash
cpio -tv < project_backup.cpio | grep script.sh
```

You confirm the file was archived — turns out, permissions were wrong on extract. You fix it by re-extracting with correct `umask`.

## 📊 Summary of Most Used Options

### `tar`

* `-c, -x, -t, -f, -v, -z`
  **Coverage: \~70%** of daily usage (others like `-j`, `-J`, `-u`, `-g` are rarer)

### `zip`

* `-r`
  **Coverage: \~80%** of daily usage (most use is just recursive zip)

### `cpio`

* `-o, -i, -t, -v, -O, -I`
  **Coverage: \~65%** of daily usage (incremental/advanced use less common)

---

✅ **Takeaway:**

* `tar` is your go-to for backups & troubleshooting.
* `zip` is handy for cross-platform sharing.
* `cpio` shines in migrations or when piping files from `find`.

# 🔧 More Sysadmin Scenarios

---

## 🛠️ 1. **System Crash Analysis with `tar`**

**Context:** Your RHEL server kernel-panicked last night. Support asks you to collect `/var/log/`, `/etc/`, and dmesg output into one file.

### Steps:

1. **Gather logs and configs**

   ```bash
   dmesg > /tmp/dmesg_output.txt
   tar -czvf sysdebug_2025-08-31.tar.gz /var/log /etc /tmp/dmesg_output.txt
   ```

   * Combines logs + configs + custom output
   * `-c` (create), `-z` (gzip), `-v` (verbose), `-f` (file name)

2. **Verify before uploading to support**

   ```bash
   tar -tvf sysdebug_2025-08-31.tar.gz | less
   ```

➡️ **Outcome:** You have a single compressed archive with all evidence — saves time for L3 engineers and avoids missing files.

---

## 📂 2. **Old Backups Cleanup with `tar`**

**Context:** Your `/backups` partition is 90% full. You need to check what’s inside old archives before deletion.

### Steps:

1. **List contents without extracting**

   ```bash
   tar -tvf /backups/app_backup_2025-05-01.tar.gz | head -20
   ```

   * Useful when you don’t want to waste disk extracting

2. **Quick size check**

   ```bash
   du -sh /backups/app_backup_2025-05-01.tar.gz
   ```

➡️ **Outcome:** You confidently delete old backups, ensuring you aren’t wiping critical files.

---

## 🔑 3. **Secure Sharing of Configs with `zip`**

**Context:** You need to send SSL certs and nginx configs to a vendor securely.

### Steps:

1. **Create password-protected zip**

   ```bash
   zip -er ssl_package.zip /etc/nginx/ssl/ /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

   * `-e` → Encrypt with password
   * `-r` → Recursive

2. **Verify contents**

   ```bash
   unzip -l ssl_package.zip
   ```

➡️ **Outcome:** Vendor gets only what they need, and encryption adds a safety layer if email is compromised.

---

## 📦 4. **App Deployment Bundle with `zip`**

**Context:** Your dev team asks for a quick bundle of static website files (`/var/www/html`). They want it on their laptops (Windows/Mac).

### Steps:

1. **Zip web root**

   ```bash
   zip -r webapp_v1.zip /var/www/html/
   ```

2. **Send over email/Slack** — works natively on all OS.

➡️ **Outcome:** Faster than tar, since `zip` is cross-platform friendly.

---

## 🔄 5. **Selective Migration with `cpio`**

**Context:** You’re migrating `/opt/projects/` to a new server but want to exclude `.git` directories.

### Steps:

1. **Create archive without git repos**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/projects
   find . -path "*/.git" -prune -o -print | cpio -ov > projects_nogit.cpio
   ```

2. **Extract on new system**

   ```bash
   cpio -iv < projects_nogit.cpio
   ```

➡️ **Outcome:** Developers get a clean codebase without unnecessary `.git` metadata.

---

## 🧩 6. **Disaster Recovery Test with `cpio`**

**Context:** You want to test if your `/etc` backup is usable.

### Steps:

1. **List contents without overwriting**

   ```bash
   cpio -tv < etc_backup.cpio | less
   ```
2. **Extract to test directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/etc_test
   cd /tmp/etc_test
   cpio -iv < /backups/etc_backup.cpio
   ```

➡️ **Outcome:** You confirm backups contain all configs, without risking overwriting `/etc`.

### `tar`

* **Most used:** `-c`, `-x`, `-t`, `-f`, `-v`, `-z`
* **Occasional:** `-j` (bzip2), `-J` (xz), `-u` (update), `-d` (compare)
  **Coverage: \~75%**

### `zip`

* **Most used:** `-r` (recursive), `-e` (encrypt)
  **Coverage: \~85%**

### `cpio`

* **Most used:** `-o`, `-i`, `-t`, `-v`, with `find` pipelines
  **Coverage: \~70%**

---

✅ **Takeaway for a sysadmin:**

* Use **tar** for backups, troubleshooting bundles, and log archiving.
* Use **zip** when **sharing cross-platform** or securing with a password.
* Use **cpio** when piping from `find`, filtering files, or testing/migrating directories.
