## **Scenario 1: A process is hanging and slowing down the server**

### **Step-by-step workflow**

1. **Identify processes consuming resources**

   ```bash
   top
   ```

   * `top` provides a real-time view of CPU and memory usage.
   * Common workflow: identify processes with high `%CPU` or `%MEM`.

2. **Check detailed info about the problematic process**

   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep <process_name>
   ```

   * `ps -ef` lists all processes with full details (UID, PID, PPID, CPU usage, command, etc.).
   * Useful to confirm the PID of the process causing issues.

3. **Adjust priority of a process that is important**

   ```bash
   renice -n 10 -p <pid>
   ```

   * `renice` changes the priority of a running process.
   * Increasing the nice value lowers priority, freeing CPU for other critical processes.

4. **Terminate a misbehaving process**

   ```bash
   kill -s SIGTERM <pid>
   ```

   * Sends `SIGTERM` to allow graceful shutdown.
   * If unresponsive after a few seconds:

     ```bash
     kill -s SIGKILL <pid>
     ```

5. **Verify process termination**

   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep <process_name>
   ```

   * Ensures the process is no longer running.

## **Scenario 2: Running a long job without disruption**

### **Step-by-step workflow**

1. **Start a command immune to hangups**

   ```bash
   nohup long_running_backup.sh &
   ```

   * `nohup` ensures the command continues even if the SSH session closes.
   * `&` sends it to the background.

2. **Check background jobs**

   ```bash
   jobs
   ```

   * Lists all jobs started in the current shell and their status (`Running` or `Stopped`).

3. **Bring a job to foreground if interaction is needed**

   ```bash
   fg %1
   ```

   * Brings job number 1 to the foreground for input or monitoring.

4. **Resume a stopped job in the background**

   ```bash
   bg %1
   ```

   * Useful if the job was accidentally paused with `Ctrl+Z`.

---

## **Scenario 3: Monitoring I/O bottlenecks**

### **Step-by-step workflow**

1. **Check real-time I/O per process**

   ```bash
   iotop
   ```

   * Shows which processes are generating the most disk I/O.

2. **Check CPU vs disk I/O for devices**

   ```bash
   iostat -c -p /dev/sda 2 5
   ```

   * `-c` â†’ CPU usage only.
   * `-p /dev/sda` â†’ Specific device stats.
   * `2 5` â†’ Run 5 reports at 2-second intervals.

3. **Analyze system-wide resource usage**

   ```bash
   vmstat 2 5
   ```

   * Summarizes processes, memory, paging, CPU, I/O.
   * Useful for seeing trends over time (every 2 seconds, 5 reports).

4. **Combine multiple stats for in-depth analysis**

   ```bash
   dstat -cdngy
   ```

   * `dstat` is like `vmstat + iostat + netstat` combined.
   * Tracks CPU, disk, network, and system stats simultaneously.

---

## **Scenario 4: Killing processes by name**

### **Step-by-step workflow**

1. **Identify and kill all instances of a process**

   ```bash
   pkill firefox
   ```

   * `pkill` kills processes matching a name pattern.

2. **Verify termination**

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep firefox
   ```

   * Ensures no residual processes are running.

---

## **Scenario 5: Running a command with different scheduling priority**

1. **Run a backup script with low priority**

   ```bash
   nice -n 19 ./backup.sh
   ```

   * `-n 19` â†’ sets lowest priority, ensuring minimal impact on interactive users.

| `pkill`  | `<pattern>`                | Kill processes by name pattern                    |
| `nice`   | `-n <value>`               | Run a command with adjusted scheduling priority   |

## **Scenario 6: Web application server suddenly becomes unresponsive**

1. **Check system load first**

   ```bash
   top
   ```

   * See if `httpd` (RHEL) or `apache2` (Ubuntu) is consuming too much CPU or memory.
   * Look for high load averages in the top right.

2. **Look at running processes in detail**

   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep apache2
   ```

   * Confirms how many worker processes are running.
   * Helps identify runaway workers.

3. **Gracefully stop all Apache processes**

   ```bash
   pkill apache2
   ```

   * Kills all Apache processes by name.
   * Safer and quicker than manually killing each PID.

4. **Restart the service**

   ```bash
   systemctl restart apache2
   ```

   * After cleaning, restart cleanly.
   * Verify with:

     ```bash
     systemctl status apache2
     ```

---

## **Scenario 7: Disk I/O bottleneck detected by monitoring system**

1. **Check per-process I/O activity**

   ```bash
   iotop
   ```

   * See if a database or logging process is hammering the disk.

2. **Check disk stats over time**

   ```bash
   iostat -xz 2 5
   ```

   * `-x` â†’ extended stats (utilization, await, svctm).
   * `-z` â†’ skip devices with no activity.
   * Interval 2 seconds, 5 samples.

3. **Look at virtual memory and paging**

   ```bash
   vmstat 2 5
   ```

   * If `si` and `so` (swap in/out) are high, system is swapping.

4. **Cross-check with general system resources**

   ```bash
   dstat -cdngy
   ```

   * Single view for CPU, disk, net, and paging.

---

## **Scenario 8: Admin accidentally stops a database job**

1. **You typed Ctrl+Z by mistake during a long query**

   * This suspends the process.

2. **List jobs**

   ```bash
   jobs
   ```

   * Shows `[1]+  Stopped  psql` (for example).

3. **Bring it back to foreground**

   ```bash
   fg %1
   ```

   * Resumes the PostgreSQL client in the foreground.

4. **Or let it run in background**

   ```bash
   bg %1
   ```

   * Continues running without holding your shell.

---

## **Scenario 9: Overnight data backup causes system slowdown**

1. **Check what is running**

   ```bash
   ps -ef | grep backup
   ```

   * Confirms which backup process is running.

2. **Lower priority of the backup**

   ```bash
   renice 19 -p <pid>
   ```

   * Ensures it does not starve interactive processes.

3. **Alternatively start it with nice**

   ```bash
   nice -n 19 ./backup.sh
   ```

   * Prevents future backups from hogging CPU.

4. **If you want it immune to SSH logout**

   ```bash
   nohup ./backup.sh > backup.log 2>&1 &
   ```

   * Job continues even if the admin disconnects.

---

## **Scenario 10: System performance issue needs historical analysis**

1. **Check live stats**

   ```bash
   sar -u 2 5
   ```

   * CPU utilization every 2 seconds, 5 samples.

2. **Check yesterdayâ€™s data**

   ```bash
   sar -q -f /var/log/sa/sa28
   ```

   * `-q` â†’ run queue and load averages.
   * `-f` â†’ use stored binary log file (`sa28` means 28th day of the month).
   * Lets you analyze what happened overnight.
